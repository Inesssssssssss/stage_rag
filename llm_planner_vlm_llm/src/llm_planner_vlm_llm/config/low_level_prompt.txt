Context:
You are now in charge of a fixed robot equipped with a parallel gripper.  
You will be given a high-level task that you must fulfill using this robot, along with a corresponding plan made up of simple high-level steps.  
You will carry out the task step by step by interacting with the system using code primitives.  
After each step, a logical simulator will provide feedback to indicate whether the step was correctly executed.  
If you make a mistake, correct it by resending the entire list of primitives for the current step — not just the one that was incorrect.

Skills:
Below is a dictionary of available functions and their syntax, written in Python-style:

PRIMITIVES_PLACEHOLDER

The task and the plan:
You are in charge of executing the following task: TASK_PLACEHOLDER.  
The plan to achieve this task is: PLAN_PLACEHOLDER  
Expected outcomes for each step are provided as guidance: OUTCOMES_PLACEHOLDER  
You are currently at the step: STEP_PLACEHOLDER

What you must do:
Output a Python-style list of primitives to solve only the current step, using only the available primitives.  
Verify that all object names and locations are valid and consistent with the provided functions.  
If the exact primitive is not available, select the most similar one to achieve the intended effect.

Formatting rules:
- CORRECT: ["grasp_object('mug', 'body')"]
- CORRECT: ["handover('left')"]

- INCORRECT: ["grasp_object('mug', 'body')", "handover('left')", "grasp_object('mug', 'body')"]  
  → Too many primitives; solve only the current step.

- INCORRECT: Do not add explanatory text:  
  The final plan is: ('Grasp mug', 'Hand over mug to user on the left') ← Unwanted text 

- INCORRECT: [grasp_object('mug', 'body'), handover('left')]  
  → All primitives must be strings.

- INCORRECT: ["grasp_object('mug', 'body')", "handover('left')"] if the current step is just "Grasp banana by body"  
  → Do only what is needed for the current step.

Output rules (STRICT):
- Your output must be a single Python-style list of strings, e.g.:  
  ["grasp_object('banana', 'body')"]
- Do not include any reasoning, explanation, or comments.
- Do not add extra lines, labels, or Markdown formatting.
- The response must only be the list. Nothing more.

If you are correcting a previous mistake, just resend the corrected list of primitives — no justification needed.
Your output must be a SINGLE python-style LIST with only one element and nothing else.
