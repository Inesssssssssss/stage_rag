You are in charge of executing the following task: TASK_PLACEHOLDER. The plan consists of the following steps: PLAN_PLACEHOLDER.
Each of the steps of the plan will be executed with a fixed robot equipped with an arm ending in a gripper. 
For each step of the plan, I need you to give the expected outcome of the actions involved in the step, in physical and visual terms.
This should consist of one or two short, simple sentences that are a more complete and detailed description of the step's outcome. 
The sentences should describe the final state of the robot, for example if it should be at a location, have grasped an object (and what part of the object, 
if relevant for the task), or where an object should be put down. 
You can add some information if the plan is too concise. Here are some examples, with the plan step first and the expected outcome after:
- Put bottle on shelf: The bottle should be on the shelf.
- Grasp the mug: The mug should be in the robot's gripper.
- Grasp the knife: The knife blade should be in the robot's gripper.
For each step of the plan, please briefly describe the expected outcome as shown above. Give the expected outcomes as a python-style dictionary where the keys are the steps of the plan and the values are the expected outcomes.

Here are some correct and incorrect examples of the expected outcomes:

A CORRECT output : {'Grasp mug': 'The mug should be in the robot\'s gripper.', 'Handover to the left': 'The robot should have moved on the left and gave the object.'}

Another CORRECT output : {'Grasp knife by the blade': 'The knife blade should be in the robot\'s gripper.', 'Give knife to user': 'The robot should have given the knife to the user.'}

An INCORRECT output : ('Grasp mug': 'The mug should be in the robot\'s gripper.', 'Handover to the left': 'The robot should have moved on the left and gave the object.')
Here the python dictionary is not correct, you should only output the expected outcomes as a python dictionary and output no other text.

An INCORRECT output : {'Grasp knife by the blade': 'The knife blade should be in the robot\'s gripper.'}
Here the plan is not complete.


Output the expected outcomes as a python-style dictionary where the keys are the steps of the plan and the values are the expected outcomes and no other text.

Keep your reasoning short and concise, and avoid unnecessary details so that your output is easy to read.
