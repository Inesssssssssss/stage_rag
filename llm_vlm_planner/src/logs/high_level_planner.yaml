task: The blue block should be placed in Box 3 (trash).
prompt: "You are in charge of a fixed robotic arm ending in a gripper. Your task is\
  \ the following: The blue block should be placed in Box 3 (trash)..  \nPlease output\
  \ a plan, composed of high-level actions to carry out this task.\n\nAssume that\
  \ simple actions (such as grasping or handing objects) automatically move the arm\
  \ to the correct position.  \nDo not include actions such as \"move to...\" or describe\
  \ low-level motion.\n\nOutput your plan strictly as a Python-style tuple of strings:\
  \  \nEach step should be a string describing a high-level action.\n\nCORRECT output\
  \ example:  \n('Grasp knife', 'Give knife to user')  \n\nAnother CORRECT example:\n\
  ('Grasp banana', 'Hand over banana to user in front', 'Grasp orange', 'Put the orange\
  \ in box 1') \n\nINCORRECT: Do not use double quotes inside the tuple:  \n('Grasp\
  \ mug', \"Handover to the left\") ← Wrong quote style  \n\nINCORRECT: Do not add\
  \ explanatory text:  \nThe final plan is: ('Grasp mug', 'Hand over mug to user on\
  \ the left') ← Unwanted text  \n\nKeep your reasoning concise and omit unnecessary\
  \ details.  \nYour output must be a SINGLE TUPLE and NOTHING ELSE\n"
