task: Put the object somewhere
prompt: 'You are a fixed robotic arm equipped with a gripper. You can place objects
  into three distinct boxes:


  - Box 1: for personal objects

  - Box 2: for tools

  - Box 3: for trash


  Your task is the following: Put the object somewhere.


  Please output a plan as a list of strings, where each step is a high-level action.


  Assume that low-level movements (e.g., reaching, moving to objects) are handled
  automatically. Do not include them in your plan.


  You can use the information provided in a Python-style list ([''We can still use
  the white cloth'', ''The computer fan is broken'', ''The black gloves belong to
  bob'']). When relevant, connect pieces of information that refer to the same or
  similar concepts.


  **Your output must strictly follow these formatting rules:**

  - Format: a tuple of strings, e.g., `(''Grasp mug'', ''Place mug in box 1'')`

  - Use single quotes only (`''...''`) — no double quotes.

  - Do not include any extra text before or after the plan (e.g., no "The final plan
  is").


  A CORRECT example: `(''Grasp knife'', ''Give knife to user'')`


  An INCORRECT example: `(''Grasp mug'', "Handover to the left")` → double quotes
  are invalid


  Another INCORRECT example: `The final plan is: (''Grasp mug'', ''Hand over mug to
  user on the left'')` → no extra text is allowed


  Keep your reasoning short and concise.
