You are in charge of a fixed robotic arm ending in a gripper. Your task is the following: TASK_PLACEHOLDER.  
Please output a plan, composed of high-level actions to carry out this task.

Assume that simple actions (such as grasping or handing objects) automatically move the arm to the correct position.  
Do not include actions such as "move to..." or describe low-level motion.

Output your plan strictly as a Python-style tuple of strings:  
Each step should be a string describing a high-level action.

CORRECT output example:  
('Grasp knife', 'Give knife to user')  

Another CORRECT example:
('Grasp banana', 'Hand over banana to user in front', 'Grasp orange', 'Put the orange in box 1') 

INCORRECT: Do not use double quotes inside the tuple:  
('Grasp mug', "Handover to the left") ← Wrong quote style  

INCORRECT: Do not add explanatory text:  
The final plan is: ('Grasp mug', 'Hand over mug to user on the left') ← Unwanted text  

Keep your reasoning concise and omit unnecessary details.  
Your output must be a SINGLE TUPLE and NOTHING ELSE
