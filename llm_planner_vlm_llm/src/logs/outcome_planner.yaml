prompt: "You are in charge of executing the following task: Put this object (The object\
  \ in the image appears to be a piece of white fabric, possibly a pillowcase or sheet,\
  \ with red stains on it. The fabric is crumpled and torn, suggesting that it may\
  \ have been used for a messy or violent activity. The red stains could be blood,\
  \ paint, or another substance that has been spilled or splattered onto the fabric.\
  \ The overall appearance of the object suggests that it may have been involved in\
  \ a dramatic or intense event.) somewhere. The plan consists of the following steps:\
  \ ('Grasp fabric', 'Place fabric in box 3').\nEach of the steps of the plan will\
  \ be executed with a fixed robot equipped with an arm ending in a gripper. \nFor\
  \ each step of the plan, I need you to give the expected outcome of the actions\
  \ involved in the step, in physical and visual terms.\nThis should consist of one\
  \ or two short, simple sentences that are a more complete and detailed description\
  \ of the step's outcome. \nThe sentences should describe the final state of the\
  \ robot, for example if it should be at a location, have grasped an object (and\
  \ what part of the object, \nif relevant for the task), or where an object should\
  \ be put down. \nYou can add some information if the plan is too concise. Here are\
  \ some examples, with the plan step first and the expected outcome after:\n- Put\
  \ bottle on shelf: The bottle should be on the shelf.\n- Grasp the mug: The mug\
  \ should be in the robot's gripper.\n- Grasp the knife: The knife blade should be\
  \ in the robot's gripper.\nFor each step of the plan, please briefly describe the\
  \ expected outcome as shown above. Give the expected outcomes as a python-style\
  \ dictionary where the keys are the steps of the plan and the values are the expected\
  \ outcomes.\n\nHere are some correct and incorrect examples of the expected outcomes:\n\
  \nA CORRECT output : {'Grasp mug': 'The mug should be in the robot\\'s gripper.',\
  \ 'Handover to the left': 'The robot should have moved on the left and gave the\
  \ object.'}\n\nAnother CORRECT output : {'Grasp knife by the blade': 'The knife\
  \ blade should be in the robot\\'s gripper.', 'Give knife to user': 'The robot should\
  \ have given the knife to the user.'}\n\nAn INCORRECT output : ('Grasp mug': 'The\
  \ mug should be in the robot\\'s gripper.', 'Handover to the left': 'The robot should\
  \ have moved on the left and gave the object.')\nHere the python dictionary is not\
  \ correct, you should only output the expected outcomes as a python dictionary and\
  \ output no other text.\n\nAn INCORRECT output : {'Grasp knife by the blade': 'The\
  \ knife blade should be in the robot\\'s gripper.'}\nHere the plan is not complete.\n\
  \n\nOutput the expected outcomes as a python-style dictionary where the keys are\
  \ the steps of the plan and the values are the expected outcomes and no other text.\n\
  \nKeep your reasoning short and concise, and avoid unnecessary details so that your\
  \ output is easy to read.\n/nothink"
