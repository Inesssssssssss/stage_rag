- Grasp green block
- Put green block in Box 2
- Grasp blue block
- Put blue block in Box 3
- Grasp light blue block
- Put light blue block in Box 1
prompt: "You are in charge of executing the following task: Grasp green block  \n\
  Put green block in Box 2  \nGrasp blue block  \nPut blue block in Box 3  \nGrasp\
  \ light blue block  \nPut light blue block in Box 1. The plan consists of the following\
  \ steps: ('Grasp green block', 'Put green block in Box 2', 'Grasp blue block', 'Put\
  \ blue block in Box 3', 'Grasp light blue block', 'Put light blue block in Box 1').\n\
  Each of the steps of the plan will be executed with a fixed robot equipped with\
  \ an arm ending in a gripper. \nFor each step of the plan, I need you to give the\
  \ expected outcome of the actions involved in the step, in physical and visual terms.\n\
  This should consist of one or two short, simple sentences that are a more complete\
  \ and detailed description of the step's outcome. \nThe sentences should describe\
  \ the final state of the robot, for example if it should be at a location, have\
  \ grasped an object (and what part of the object, \nif relevant for the task), or\
  \ where an object should be put down. \nYou can add some information if the plan\
  \ is too concise. Here are some examples, with the plan step first and the expected\
  \ outcome after:\n- Put bottle on shelf: The bottle should be on the shelf.\n- Grasp\
  \ the mug: The mug should be in the robot's gripper.\n- Grasp the knife: The knife\
  \ blade should be in the robot's gripper.\nFor each step of the plan, please briefly\
  \ describe the expected outcome as shown above. Give the expected outcomes as a\
  \ python-style dictionary where the keys are the steps of the plan and the values\
  \ are the expected outcomes.\n\nHere are some correct and incorrect examples of\
  \ the expected outcomes:\n\nA CORRECT output : {'Grasp mug': 'The mug should be\
  \ in the robot\\'s gripper.', 'Handover to the left': 'The robot should have moved\
  \ on the left and gave the object.'}\n\nAnother CORRECT output : {'Grasp knife by\
  \ the blade': 'The knife blade should be in the robot\\'s gripper.', 'Give knife\
  \ to user': 'The robot should have given the knife to the user.'}\n\nAn INCORRECT\
  \ output : ('Grasp mug': 'The mug should be in the robot\\'s gripper.', 'Handover\
  \ to the left': 'The robot should have moved on the left and gave the object.')\n\
  Here the python dictionary is not correct, you should only output the expected outcomes\
  \ as a python dictionary and output no other text.\n\nAn INCORRECT output : {'Grasp\
  \ knife by the blade': 'The knife blade should be in the robot\\'s gripper.'}\n\
  Here the plan is not complete.\n\n\nOutput the expected outcomes as a python-style\
  \ dictionary where the keys are the steps of the plan and the values are the expected\
  \ outcomes and no other text.\n\nKeep your reasoning short and concise, and avoid\
  \ unnecessary details so that your output is easy to read.\n/nothink"
