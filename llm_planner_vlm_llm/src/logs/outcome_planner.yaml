prompt: "You are in charge of executing the following task: Grasp red cup  \nPut red\
  \ cup in Box 2  \n\nGrasp banana  \nPut banana in Box 1  \n\nGrasp green Lego brick\
  \  \nPut green Lego brick in Box 2  \n\nGrasp blue Lego brick  \nPut blue Lego brick\
  \ in Box 2. The plan consists of the following steps: ('Grasp red cup', 'Put red\
  \ cup in Box 2', 'Grasp banana', 'Put banana in Box 1', 'Grasp green Lego brick',\
  \ 'Put green Lego brick in Box 2', 'Grasp blue Lego brick', 'Put blue Lego brick\
  \ in Box 2').\nEach of the steps of the plan will be executed with a fixed robot\
  \ equipped with an arm ending in a gripper. \nFor each step of the plan, I need\
  \ you to give the expected outcome of the actions involved in the step, in physical\
  \ and visual terms.\nThis should consist of one or two short, simple sentences that\
  \ are a more complete and detailed description of the step's outcome. \nThe sentences\
  \ should describe the final state of the robot, for example if it should be at a\
  \ location, have grasped an object (and what part of the object, \nif relevant for\
  \ the task), or where an object should be put down. \nYou can add some information\
  \ if the plan is too concise. Here are some examples, with the plan step first and\
  \ the expected outcome after:\n- Put bottle on shelf: The bottle should be on the\
  \ shelf.\n- Grasp the mug: The mug should be in the robot's gripper.\n- Grasp the\
  \ knife: The knife blade should be in the robot's gripper.\nFor each step of the\
  \ plan, please briefly describe the expected outcome as shown above. Give the expected\
  \ outcomes as a python-style dictionary where the keys are the steps of the plan\
  \ and the values are the expected outcomes.\n\nHere are some correct and incorrect\
  \ examples of the expected outcomes:\n\nA CORRECT output : {'Grasp mug': 'The mug\
  \ should be in the robot\\'s gripper.', 'Handover to the left': 'The robot should\
  \ have moved on the left and gave the object.'}\n\nAnother CORRECT output : {'Grasp\
  \ knife by the blade': 'The knife blade should be in the robot\\'s gripper.', 'Give\
  \ knife to user': 'The robot should have given the knife to the user.'}\n\nAn INCORRECT\
  \ output : ('Grasp mug': 'The mug should be in the robot\\'s gripper.', 'Handover\
  \ to the left': 'The robot should have moved on the left and gave the object.')\n\
  Here the python dictionary is not correct, you should only output the expected outcomes\
  \ as a python dictionary and output no other text.\n\nAn INCORRECT output : {'Grasp\
  \ knife by the blade': 'The knife blade should be in the robot\\'s gripper.'}\n\
  Here the plan is not complete.\n\n\nOutput the expected outcomes as a python-style\
  \ dictionary where the keys are the steps of the plan and the values are the expected\
  \ outcomes and no other text.\n\nKeep your reasoning short and concise, and avoid\
  \ unnecessary details so that your output is easy to read.\n/nothink"
