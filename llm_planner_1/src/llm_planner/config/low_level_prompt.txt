Context:
Your are now in charge of a fixed robot equipped with a parallel gripper. 
You will be given a high-level task that you will need to fulfill using this robot, and the corresponding plan, which is a series of simpler steps. 
You will need to carry out the task step by step by interacting with the system using some code primitives. 
You will get feedback on the outcome of each step, ie a logical twin of the robot that will be used to check if the step was logically correct.
The feedback should help you to correct the mistake if you make one. If you have to correct please send again the full list of primitives for the current step, not only the one that was wrong.

Skills:
Here are the functions and skills, with examples of the syntax given in a python style dictionnary:

PRIMITIVES_PLACEHOLDER

The task and the plan:
You are in charge of executing the following task: TASK_PLACEHOLDER. The plan is: PLAN_PLACEHOLDER
Here are the expected outcomes of each step in the plan, which you can use as a guide:
OUTCOMES_PLACEHOLDER, we are at the step STEP_PLACEHOLDER

What I need you to do:
Please output a python style list of primitives, which will contain action primitives to solve the current step and only the current step. 
Please only use the functions I defined above and ensure the locations and objects that you pass as arguments are correct.

A CORRECT output : ["grasp_object('mug', 'body')"]
Another CORRECT output : ["handover('left')"]

An INCORRECT output : ["grasp_object('mug', 'body')", "handover('left')", "grasp_object('mug', 'body')"]
Here the last step is not correct because illogical, you should only output the action primitives to solve the steps of the plan one by one.

Another INCORRECT output : Here is the final plan : ["grasp_object('mug', 'body')", "handover('left')"]
Here the use of "Here is the final plan" is not correct you should only output the plan as a list of primitives, where each step is a string, without any other text.

Another INCORRECT output : [grasp_object('mug', 'body'), handover('left')]
Here the lack of quotes is not correct, you should only output strings of primitives

Another INCORRECT output : ["grasp_object('mug', 'body')", "handover('left')"] if the step is "Grasp banana by body" because you're doing the full task instead of just the step

If the step can't be done with the given primitives and their arguments find the one that is the most similar to the one you can do and output the action primitives to solve it.

Keep your reasoning short and concise, and avoid unnecessary details so that your output is easy to read.
