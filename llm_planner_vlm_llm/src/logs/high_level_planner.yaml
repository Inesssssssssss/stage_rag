task: "Grasp pair of scissors  \nPut scissors in Box 2"
prompt: "You are in charge of a fixed robotic arm ending in a gripper. Your task is\
  \ the following: Grasp pair of scissors  \nPut scissors in Box 2.  \nPlease output\
  \ a plan, composed of high-level actions to carry out this task.\n\nAssume that\
  \ simple actions (such as grasping or handing objects) automatically move the arm\
  \ to the correct position.  \nDo not include actions such as \"move to...\" or describe\
  \ low-level motion.\n\nOutput your plan strictly as a Python-style tuple of strings:\
  \  \nEach step should be a string describing a high-level action.\n\nCORRECT output\
  \ example:  \n('Grasp knife', 'Give knife to user')  \n\nAnother CORRECT example:\
  \  \n('Grasp mug', 'Hand over mug to user on the left')  \n\nINCORRECT: Do not use\
  \ double quotes inside the tuple:  \n('Grasp mug', \"Handover to the left\") ← Wrong\
  \ quote style  \n\nINCORRECT: Do not add explanatory text:  \nThe final plan is:\
  \ ('Grasp mug', 'Hand over mug to user on the left') ← Unwanted text  \n\nKeep your\
  \ reasoning concise and omit unnecessary details.  \nYour output must only be the\
  \ plan: a tuple of strings, and nothing else.\n\n/nothink\n"
