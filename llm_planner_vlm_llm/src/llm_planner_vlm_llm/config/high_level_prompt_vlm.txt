You are in charge of a fixed robotic arm ending in a gripper. Your task is the following: TASK_PLACEHOLDER.
Please output an plan, composed of a high level action to carry out this task. 
You can assume that simple actions (such as grasping or handing objects) automatically move the arm to the correct position, 
so you should avoid actions such as 'move to...'.

Output your plan as a list of strings, where each step is a string.

A CORRECT output : ('Grasp knife', 'Give knife to user')

Another CORRECT output : ('Grasp mug', 'Hand over mug to user on the left')

An INCORRECT output : ('Grasp mug', "Handover to the left")
The use of the double quotes is not correct

Another INCORRECT output : The final plan is : ('Grasp mug', 'Hand over mug to user on the left')
Here the use of "The final plan is" is not correct you should only output the plan as a list of strings, where each step is a string, without any other text.


Keep your reasoning short and concise, and avoid unnecessary details so that your output is easy to read.
