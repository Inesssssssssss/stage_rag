task: I need to hang a canva on the wall
prompt: "You are in charge of a fixed robotic arm ending in a gripper. Your task is\
  \ the following: I need to hang a canva on the wall.\nPlease output an plan, composed\
  \ of a high level action to carry out this task. \nYou can assume that simple actions\
  \ (such as grasping or handing objects) automatically move the arm to the correct\
  \ position, \nso you should avoid actions such as 'move to...'.\nYou can use this\
  \ different informations given in a python style list, try to connect all the informations\
  \ between them when you see similarity between sentences : ['I need a screw to hang\
  \ the canva', 'The user is in front of you', 'When the user is hungry, he wants\
  \ to eat food', 'Water is put in a mug', 'Banana is food']\n\nOutput your plan as\
  \ a list of strings, where each step is a string.\n\nA CORRECT output : ('Grasp\
  \ knife', 'Give knife to user')\n\nAnother CORRECT output : ('Grasp mug', 'Hand\
  \ over mug to user on the left')\n\nAn INCORRECT output : ('Grasp mug', \"Handover\
  \ to the left\")\nThe use of the double quotes is not correct\n\nAnother INCORRECT\
  \ output : The final plan is : ('Grasp mug', 'Hand over mug to user on the left')\n\
  Here the use of \"The final plan is\" is not correct you should only output the\
  \ plan as a list of strings, where each step is a string, without any other text.\n\
  \n\nKeep your reasoning short and concise, and avoid unnecessary details so that\
  \ your output is easy to read.\n/nothink"
