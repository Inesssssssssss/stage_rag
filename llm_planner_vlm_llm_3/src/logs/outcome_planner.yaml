prompt: "You are in charge of executing the following task: Put this object (The object\
  \ in the image is a pair of gloves. They appear to be made of a thick, textured\
  \ material, possibly rubber or a similar synthetic material. The gloves have a black\
  \ palm side and a white back side, with a black cuff at the wrist. They are laid\
  \ flat on a wooden surface, with the fingers of one glove curled over the other.\
  \ The gloves appear to be new, with no visible signs of wear or damage. They may\
  \ be intended for use in a specific industry or activity, such as construction or\
  \ gardening. Overall, the gloves seem to be a practical and functional piece of\
  \ equipment, designed to provide protection and support for the hands.) somewhere.\
  \ The plan consists of the following steps: ('Grasp gloves', 'Place gloves in box\
  \ 1').\nEach of the steps of the plan will be executed with a fixed robot equipped\
  \ with an arm ending in a gripper. \nFor each step of the plan, I need you to give\
  \ the expected outcome of the actions involved in the step, in physical and visual\
  \ terms.\nThis should consist of one or two short, simple sentences that are a more\
  \ complete and detailed description of the step's outcome. \nThe sentences should\
  \ describe the final state of the robot, for example if it should be at a location,\
  \ have grasped an object (and what part of the object, \nif relevant for the task),\
  \ or where an object should be put down. \nYou can add some information if the plan\
  \ is too concise. Here are some examples, with the plan step first and the expected\
  \ outcome after:\n- Put bottle on shelf: The bottle should be on the shelf.\n- Grasp\
  \ the mug: The mug should be in the robot's gripper.\n- Grasp the knife: The knife\
  \ blade should be in the robot's gripper.\nFor each step of the plan, please briefly\
  \ describe the expected outcome as shown above. Give the expected outcomes as a\
  \ python-style dictionary where the keys are the steps of the plan and the values\
  \ are the expected outcomes.\n\nHere are some correct and incorrect examples of\
  \ the expected outcomes:\n\nA CORRECT output : {'Grasp mug': 'The mug should be\
  \ in the robot\\'s gripper.', 'Handover to the left': 'The robot should have moved\
  \ on the left and gave the object.'}\n\nAnother CORRECT output : {'Grasp knife by\
  \ the blade': 'The knife blade should be in the robot\\'s gripper.', 'Give knife\
  \ to user': 'The robot should have given the knife to the user.'}\n\nAn INCORRECT\
  \ output : ('Grasp mug': 'The mug should be in the robot\\'s gripper.', 'Handover\
  \ to the left': 'The robot should have moved on the left and gave the object.')\n\
  Here the python dictionary is not correct, you should only output the expected outcomes\
  \ as a python dictionary and output no other text.\n\nAn INCORRECT output : {'Grasp\
  \ knife by the blade': 'The knife blade should be in the robot\\'s gripper.'}\n\
  Here the plan is not complete.\n\n\nOutput the expected outcomes as a python-style\
  \ dictionary where the keys are the steps of the plan and the values are the expected\
  \ outcomes and no other text.\n\nKeep your reasoning short and concise, and avoid\
  \ unnecessary details so that your output is easy to read.\n/nothink"
