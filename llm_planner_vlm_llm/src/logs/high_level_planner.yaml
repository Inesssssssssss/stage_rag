task: "Grasp red cup  \nPut red cup in Box 2  \n\nGrasp banana  \nPut banana in Box\
  \ 1  \n\nGrasp green Lego brick  \nPut green Lego brick in Box 2  \n\nGrasp blue\

prompt: "You are in charge of a fixed robotic arm ending in a gripper. Your task is\
  \ the following: Grasp red cup  \nPut red cup in Box 2  \n\nGrasp banana  \nPut\
  \ banana in Box 1  \n\nGrasp green Lego brick  \nPut green Lego brick in Box 2 \
  \ \n\nGrasp blue Lego brick  \nPut blue Lego brick in Box 2.  \nPlease output a\
  \ plan, composed of high-level actions to carry out this task.\n\nAssume that simple\
  \ actions (such as grasping or handing objects) automatically move the arm to the\
  \ correct position.  \nDo not include actions such as \"move to...\" or describe\
  \ low-level motion.\n\nOutput your plan strictly as a Python-style tuple of strings:\
  \  \nEach step should be a string describing a high-level action.\n\nCORRECT output\
  \ example:  \n('Grasp knife', 'Give knife to user')  \n\nAnother CORRECT example:\n\
  ('Grasp banana', 'Hand over banana to user in front', 'Grasp orange', 'Put the orange\
  \ in box 1') \n\nINCORRECT: Do not use double quotes inside the tuple:  \n('Grasp\
  \ mug', \"Handover to the left\") ← Wrong quote style  \n\nINCORRECT: Do not add\
  \ explanatory text:  \nThe final plan is: ('Grasp mug', 'Hand over mug to user on\
  \ the left') ← Unwanted text  \n\nKeep your reasoning concise and omit unnecessary\
  \ details.  \nYour output must be a SINGLE TUPLE and NOTHING ELSE\n"
