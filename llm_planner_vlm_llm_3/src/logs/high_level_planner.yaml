prompt: 'You are a fixed robotic arm equipped with a gripper. You can place objects
  into three distinct boxes:


  - Box 1: for personal objects

  - Box 2: for tools

  - Box 3: for trash


  Your task is the following: Put this object (The object in the image is a pair of
  gloves. They appear to be made of a thick, textured material, possibly rubber or
  a similar synthetic material. The gloves have a black palm side and a white back
  side, with a black cuff at the wrist. They are laid flat on a wooden surface, with
  the fingers of one glove curled over the other. The gloves appear to be new, with
  no visible signs of wear or damage. They may be intended for use in a specific industry

  Please output a plan as a list of strings, where each step is a high-level action.


  Assume that low-level movements (e.g., reaching, moving to objects) are handled
  automatically. Do not include them in your plan.


  You can use this different informations given in a python style list, try to connect
  all the informations between them when you see similarity between sentences : [''The
  black gloves belong to bob'', ''The computer fan is broken'']


  **Your output must strictly follow these formatting rules:**

  - Format: a tuple of strings, e.g., `(''Grasp mug'', ''Place mug in box 1'')`

  - Use single quotes only (`''...''`) — no double quotes.

  - Do not include any extra text before or after the plan (e.g., no "The final plan
  is").


  A CORRECT example: `(''Grasp knife'', ''Give knife to user'')`


  An INCORRECT example: `(''Grasp mug'', "Handover to the left")` → double quotes
  are invalid


  Another INCORRECT example: `The final plan is: (''Grasp mug'', ''Hand over mug to
  user on the left'')` → no extra text is allowed


  Keep your reasoning short and concise.

  Okay, let''s see. The user wants me to place a pair of gloves into one of the three
  boxes. The gloves are described as black with a white back, thick material, new,
  possibly for construction or gardening. The key info given is that the black gloves
  belong to Bob, and the computer fan is broken. Wait, the computer fan being broken
  might not be relevant here. But the gloves belong to Bob, so they are personal objects.
  So Box 1 is for personal objects. Therefore, the plan should be to grasp the gloves
  and place them in Box 1. The other info about the fan might be a red herring, but
  since the gloves are personal, Box 1 is the right choice. So the steps are ''Grasp
  gloves'' and ''Place gloves in box 1''.

  (''Grasp gloves'', ''Place gloves in box 1'')'
response: ('Grasp gloves', 'Place gloves in box 1')
